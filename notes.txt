 add pins for i2c and serial for GPS / si5351
 add pins for anenmomentor (interupt pin + vcc + gnd?)
 figure out how many SERCOMs to set up as SPI devices
 breakout arduino pins

current issue:

how do I assign pins so that I can use them in arduino?

options:

steal feather m0 layout
 - no writing code
 - maybe can't break out all pins the right way?
 - can't use multiple SPIs
make my owns
 - don't know how
 - might not use pins right


next steps:
 - google multiple SPI on arduino?
 - check how SERCOM works on SAMD with Arduino
 - look at schematic for feather m0 express


how does sercom work?
seems like pins can be use in SERCOM or SERCOM_ALT mode, each pin has 2 sercom it can belong to.
Can pads overlap? no, one per sercom
what is a pad? set of 4 pins for each SERCOM


page 28 of datasheet has pin table

how many SPIs do I need?

 - what is each SPI mode that I need for my devices?
  - BMP388: active low, mode 0
  - SD Card: active low, mode 0 (maybe mode 1?)
  - LoRa: The SPI interface gives access to the configuration register via a synchronous full-duplex protocol corresponding to
CPOL = 0 and CPHA = 0 (pg75 of RFM9x manual), also active low
  - SPI flash: SPI bus operation Mode 0 (0,0) and 3 (1,1) are supporte


FLASH

 do I need to do anything with hold or reset? what about write protect?


SD Card

Probably needs it's own SPI / Sercom



SERCOM and USB??


available sercoms:

 - sercom 0 (4 pads)
 - sercom 1 (4 pads) 
 - sercom 2 (4 pads)
 - sercom 3 (2 pads) -> I2C breakout
 - sercom 4 (4 pads)
 - sercom 5 (4 pads)
