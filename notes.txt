TODO

 - assign arduino pin numbers
 - oscilator crystal selection / caps
 - replace LDO with higher amp one
 - figure out if chip selects need pull ups
 - read lora datasheet for pins

----

how do I assign pins so that I can use them in arduino? -> variants.h / variants.cpp

how does sercom work?
seems like pins can be use in SERCOM or SERCOM_ALT mode, each pin has 2 sercom it can belong to.
Can pads overlap? no, one per sercom
what is a pad? set of 4 pins for each SERCOM

page 28 of datasheet has pin table

how many SPIs do I need?

 - what is each SPI mode that I need for my devices?
  - BMP388: active low, mode 0
  - SD Card: active low, mode 0 (maybe mode 1?)
  - LoRa: The SPI interface gives access to the configuration register via a synchronous full-duplex protocol corresponding to
CPOL = 0 and CPHA = 0 (pg75 of RFM9x manual), also active low
  - SPI flash: SPI bus operation Mode 0 (0,0) and 3 (1,1) are supporte


FLASH

 do I need to do anything with hold or reset? what about write protect? -> yes, hold high according to data sheet


SERCOM and USB? -> it's fine, they are seperate things


available sercoms:

 - sercom 0 (4 pads) -> microSD
 - sercom 1 (4 pads) -> SPI flash
 - sercom 2 (4 pads) -> BMP388
 - sercom 3 (2 pads) -> I2C breakout
 - sercom 4 (4 pads) -> LoRa
 - sercom 5 (4 pads) -> Serial

battery monitoring

do I add mosfet in exchange for 0 power draw? or let the battery slowly discharge

chip select pullups

"best" practice is yes when shared. SPI flash has it anyway on feather m0 express though
