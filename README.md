## Building

 The `gerbers` folder has a zip file if you want to order your own PCB.

 There is a `bom.csv` that contains all the parts and digikey part numbers you need

 There's also an `interactive_bom.html` that is from the excellent [InteractiveHtmlBom](https://github.com/openscopeproject/InteractiveHtmlBom) plugin

 ## Known Issues

 ### Rev 1

  1. microSD footprint is backwards, so it is un-usable
  1. Battery and battery charging to do not work. I plugged one in, immediatly smelled burning. Current theory is that I forgot a current limiting resistor on the LDO's EN pin, so too much current from battery (but not from USB).
