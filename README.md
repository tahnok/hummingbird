## Building

 The `gerbers` folder has a zip file if you want to order your own PCB.

 There is a `bom.csv` that contains all the parts and digikey part numbers you need

 There's also an `interactive_bom.html` that is from the excellent [InteractiveHtmlBom](https://github.com/openscopeproject/InteractiveHtmlBom) plugin
